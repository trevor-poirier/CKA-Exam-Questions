Question #1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A kubeadm cluster was migrated to a new machine. Requires configuration changes 
to run successfully. 

Fix this single-node cluster that was broken during migration. The cluster previously
ran an external etcd server. Be sure to restart all necessary components/services.
